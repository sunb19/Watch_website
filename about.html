      <h1>About LKS Timepieces</h1>
      <p class="sub">At LKS Timepieces, every watch tells more than time—it tells a story. My passion for watches started as a personal fascination with the precision, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance of Rolex. What began as curiosity soon grew into a lifelong pursuit of collecting, studying, and sharing these extraordinary pieces. For me, each watch carries history, artistry, and the joy of being passed on to someone who will treasure it. Building this store is not just about showcasing luxury timepieces, but about connecting with people who share the same appreciation for detail, heritage, and authenticity. Every watch in our collection is carefully sourced, verified, and presented with the same care I would give to my own.</p>
